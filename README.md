### Prerequisites

Your working station should have Maven 3 installed. On OS X with Homebrew, install it with `brew install maven`.

### Configuring your Maven user settings

See [Setting Up Environment](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial#Plugintutorial-SettingUpEnvironment) in the Jenkins Plugin tutorial.

### Importing the project in IntelliJ Idea

Click on Import project and select the project's `pom.xml` from where you just cloned the repository.

Ensure the following things are selected during the import process:

- Profiles to use: `jenkins`
- Projects to import: `com.deveo.plugins:deveo:1.5-SNAPSHOT`
- Project SDK to use: `1.6`

If the IDE suggests that you should reload your project, do so.
